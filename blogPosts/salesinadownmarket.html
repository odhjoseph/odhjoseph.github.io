                  <p>As a salesperson in the mattress industry, I have always been on the lookout for new opportunities to increase sales and expand our customer base. Recently, I stumbled upon an under-targeted market that has proven to be a valuable source of revenue for our company: nuns.<br>Nuns, like any other person, need comfortable and durable beds to get a good night's sleep. However, many nunneries have limited budgets and may not have the resources to purchase new mattresses as often as they would like. Additionally, the nature of their work often requires them to have mattresses that are durable and long-lasting.<br>I saw this as an opportunity for our company to provide a valuable service to these communities. I began by reaching out to the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic congregation of women religious, and establishing a relationship with them. By understanding their specific needs and offering customized solutions, such as flame-retardant materials and sturdy construction, we were able to provide them with high-quality mattresses at an affordable price.<br>As a result of this partnership, we have seen an increase in sales and the Little Sisters of the Poor were able to improve the sleeping conditions of their nuns. This success has led to other nunneries approaching us and we were able to expand our customer base. This has allowed us to not only meet our sales quota but also to make a positive impact on the community.<br>This experience has taught me the importance of identifying under-targeted markets and the potential they hold. By understanding the specific needs of our customers, we are able to provide them with the best possible service and increase our sales. The mattress industry is highly competitive, and by targeting new markets, we can increase revenue and remain competitive.<br><br></p>
